- 👋 Hi, I’m @pnk-d. I'm just trying to learn about programming, in both the frameworks that I mainly use: Angular and RoR. I will use this as a repo of all the info I gather and the things i develop while I learn. 
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity (as a pure, genuine interest) and, most importantly, game design. I know that's not a programming language and actually has little to do with CS, but it's my passion. For as long as I can remember, my life has been surrounded by videogames, and I enjoy wasting time thinking new gameplay ideas or beautiful stories I would like to put into pixel. I will look into it in the future. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning RoR, Python and Angular, mainly by headbutting against them, and I will try to have a more formal education in the timeslots that I have to spare. This will serve as a log of that work, in a way. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something great, something precious. I want to create art. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't know if I'll post my contact information here. I guess you can shoot me an email to the account associated to this but I still feel a bit weird about all this, so let me hide behind a name that has nothing to do w/ me and is a reference to something I like.
